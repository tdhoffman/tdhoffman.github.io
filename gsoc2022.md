## 2. Base Class Rethinking
*Posted 1 July 2022*

This week, I accomplished my two goals of implementing `scikit-learn`-compatible versions of [`Moran_Local`](https://github.com/tdhoffman/esda/blob/master/esda/sklearn_moran.py) and [`GM_Lag`](https://github.com/tdhoffman/spreg/blob/master/spreg/sklearn_twosls_sp.py) and starting discussions about converting PySAL's style. In doing this, I got a better picture of the potential advantages and disadvantages of the paradigm.

One issue I ran into while building out the demo classes was the location of the spatial weights matrix in a `scikit-learn` style estimator. Putting the matrix in the `__init__` method of a class implies that the matrix is a parameter rather than data, whereas putting the matrix in the `fit` method of a class implies that it is data rather than a parameter. Each choice has implications on the format and usage of the class. Personally, I prefer placing the spatial weights matrix in the `__init__` method as that choice encourages users to tune hyperparameters of the estimator for each spatial domain they are handling. However, this could lead to memory issues if users need to analyze many spatial domains. This dilemma was also noticed by Martin Fleischmann in the `esda` issue thread.

In `spreg`, Eli Knaap and Luc Anselin discussed how PySAL and `scikit-learn` have generally different objectives in their modeling frameworks: the former is typically focused on inference and interpretation, while the latter is centered around prediction. These different use cases affect the design patterns of the two libraries, and as a result it may not make sense to mimic the design pattern from `scikit-learn`. Of course, Wilkinson formulas were viewed as being useful to users on this thread as they reflect how social scientists think about models, thus making the library more accessible to a wider base of users. 

For these reasons, I think it may be more useful to design a set of PySAL-specific base classes. While `scikit-learn` and multiple dispatch might not be great fits for the library, it still needs consistent standards (whether or not they conform to external rules). Creating a PySAL-specific framework would have several key advantages, like in-house maintainability and customizability. This week, my goals are to begin prototyping Wilkinson formulas (as they are universally popular) and to think of design constraints for a set of PySAL-specific base classes.
    
## 1. Initial Goals
*Posted 26 June 2022*

At our first meeting, my mentors and I discussed the options we have for implementing new interfaces to PySAL's model and exploratory statistic classes. We discussed using multiple dispatch or ducktyping from `scikit-learn` and chose to begin with ducktyping `scikit-learn` as multiple dispatch has been deemed non-Pythonic. While developing functionality for Wilkinson formulas is an ancillary goal of this project, we are keeping it in mind as we make interface edits as those structural changes affect the formula implementation.

My first two goals are as follows:
1. Choose an unsupervised statistic (`Moran_Local`) and a supervised statistic (`GM_Lag`) and implement them using the `scikit-learn` paradigm. This will give us two concrete, minimal working examples that we can share to package leads.
2. Start issues in relevant packages to fill out the cells in the table below. We want to know what must be done for each package to switch to a `scikit-learn` interface and to extend it to Wilkinson formulas.

| Package | Requirements for ducktyping `scikit-learn` | Requirements for extending to Wilkinson formulas |
| :-----: | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `spreg` | | |
| `gwr`   | | |
| `esda`  | | |
| `spopt` | | |
|`weights`| | |
| `spglm` | | |
| ...     | | |

Finally, we aim to include automatic attribution tools to all the new interfaces so that users may easily generate the proper citations for the code they are using.
