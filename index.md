## About
Coming from a background of math and computer science, I develop algorithms and statistical methods for spatial data science. My work aims to better represent and mathematically model spatial problems and to chip away at our understanding of core geographical concepts, such as scale and process. Through algorithm design, I also seek to advance the principled use of (spatial) data science in social science. In my spare time, I love watching movies, playing video games, and biking. I'm currently a Ph.D student at Arizona State University in the Spatial Analysis Research Center (SPARC). 

## Research
Under developmentâ€”more info about my work will go here eventually!

## Fun stuff
I was [featured during ASU Geo Week](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWdsyo5v3We/?utm_medium=copy_link)!
