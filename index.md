## About
Coming from a background of math and computer science, I develop algorithms and statistical methods for spatial data science. My work aims to better represent and mathematically model spatial problems and to chip away at our understanding of core geographical concepts, such as process and scale. Through algorithm design, I also seek to advance the principled use of (spatial) data science in social science. For more information about my research, [click here](https://tdhoffman.com/research) (slightly outdated). In my spare time, I love watching movies, playing piano, and biking. I am a recipient of the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and I'm currently a Ph.D student at Arizona State University in the Spatial Analysis Research Center (SPARC). 

## News and Updates

You can find out more about the talk [from the flyer](https://urbanai.tamids.tamu.edu/2023/04/28/built-env-talk-series-tyler-d-hoffman/).

**17 Apr 2023:** Our contribution to the Geographic Information Science Body of Knowledge online encyclopedia has been published! Find out more about spatial autoregressive models [at this link](https://gistbok.ucgis.org/bok-topics/spatial-autoregressive-models).

**7 Apr 2023:** Version 0.0.1 of my first Python package is now live! 
[`spycause`, a package for spatial causal inference in Python](https://pypi.org/project/spycause/0.0.1/), can be installed from PyPI using `pip install spycause`.
Learn more at [`spycause.readthedocs.io`](spycause.readthedocs.io) or [visit the repository](https://github.com/tdhoffman/spycause) to see the source code!

**26 Mar 2023:** I was selected as the 2nd place winner of the 2023 Spatial Analysis and Modeling John Odland Student Paper Competition! Stay tuned for the full paper!
