## About
Coming from a background of math and computer science, Tyler is interested in methods development and algorithm design for spatial data science. He's also an advocate for the use of spatial methods in broader research. In his spare time, Tyler loves watching movies, playing video games, and biking. He's currently a Ph.D student at Arizona State University in the Spatial Analysis Research Center (SPARC).
