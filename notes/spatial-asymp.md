In classical statistics, asymptotic properties of estimators (our prototype here will be consistency) are relatively straightforward to establish: take $n$, the number of samples, to infinity and study what happens to the statistic in question.
However, in spatial settings, this task is not so straightforward.
If there is only one observation of a variable per spatial unit, then what does it mean to take $n$ to infinity?

It turns out
